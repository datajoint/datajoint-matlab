## Fetch

DataJoint for MATLAB provides three distinct fetch methods: `fetch`, `fetch1`, and
`fetchn`. The three methods differ by the type and number of their returned variables.

- `query.fetch` returns the result in the form of an *n* â¨‰ 1 [struct array](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/struct.html)
  where *n* is the number of records matching the query expression.

- `query.fetch1` and `query.fetchn` split the result into separate output arguments, one
  for each attribute of the query.

The types of the variables returned by `fetch1` and `fetchn` depend on the datatypes of
the attributes. `query.fetchn` will enclose any attributes of char and blob types in
[cell arrays](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/cell-arrays.html) whereas
`query.fetch1` will unpack them.

MATLAB has two alternative forms of invoking a method on an object: using the dot
notation or passing the object as the first argument. The following two notations
produce an equivalent result:

``` matlab
result = query.fetch(query, 'attr1')
result = fetch(query, 'attr1')
```

However, the dot syntax only works when the query object is already assigned to a
variable. The second syntax is more commonly used to avoid extra variables.

For example, the two methods below are equivalent although the second
method creates an extra variable.

``` matlab
result = fetch(my_schema.Rectangle, '*');

query = my_schema.Rectangle;
result = query.fetch()
```

### The primary key

Without any arguments, the `fetch` method retrieves the primary key values of the table
in the form of a single column `struct`. The attribute names become the fieldnames of
the `struct`.

``` matlab
keys = query.fetch;
keys = fetch(my_schema.Rectangle & my_schema.Area);
```

Note that MATLAB allows calling functions without the parentheses `()`.

### An entire query

With a single-quoted asterisk (`'*'`) as the input argument, the `fetch` command
retrieves the entire result as a struct array.

``` matlab
data = query.fetch('*');
data = fetch(my_schema.Rectangle & my_schema.Area, '*');
```

??? Note "For very large tables..."

    In some cases, the amount of data returned by fetch can be quite large. When `query`
    is a table object rather than a query expression, `query.sizeOnDisk()` reports the
    estimated size of the entire table. It can be used to assess whether running
    `query.fetch('*')` would be wise. Please note that it is only currently possible to
    query the size of entire tables stored directly in the database .

### Separate variables

The `fetch1` and `fetchn` methods are used to retrieve each attribute into a separate
variable. DataJoint needs two different methods to tell MATLAB whether the result
should be in array or scalar form; for numerical fields it does not matter
(because scalars are still matrices in MATLAB) but non-uniform collections of values
must be enclosed in cell arrays.

`query.fetch1` is used when `query` contains exactly one entity, otherwise `fetch1` will
raise an error.

`query.fetchn` returns an arbitrary number of elements with character arrays and blobs
returned in the form of cell arrays, even when `query` happens to contain a single
entity.

``` matlab
[shape_id, height] = query.fetch1('shape_id', 'shape_height'); % (1)
[shape_ids, heights] = query.fetchn('shape_id', 'shape_height'); % (2)
```

1. When the table has exactly one entity.
2. When the table has any number of entities:

### The primary key and individual values

It is often convenient to know the primary key values corresponding to attribute values
retrieved by `fetchn`. This can be done by adding a special input argument indicating
the request and another output argument to receive the key values:

``` matlab
[shape_ids, heights, keys] = query.fetchn('shape_id', 'shape_height', 'KEY');
```

The resulting value of `keys` will be a column array of type `struct`.
This mechanism is only implemented for `fetchn`.

### Rename and calculate

In DataJoint for MATLAB, all `fetch` methods have all the same capability as the 
[`proj` operator](../operators#proj). For example, renaming an attribute can be 
accomplished using the syntax below.

``` matlab
[shape_ids, perimeter] = query.fetchn('shape_id', ...
    '2*(shape_height+shape_width) -> perimeter');
```

See [`proj`](../operators#proj) for an in-depth description of projection.

### Sorting results

To sort the result, add the additional `ORDER BY` argument in `fetch` and `fetchn`
methods as the last argument. 

The following command retrieves the field `shape_id` from rectangles with height greater
than 2, sorted by width.

``` matlab
notes = fetchn(my_schema.Rectangle & 'shape_height>2"', 'shape_id' ...
     'ORDER BY shape_width');
```

The ORDER BY argument is passed directly to SQL and follows the same syntax as the 
[ORDER BY clause](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/order-by-optimization.html)

Similarly, the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses can be used to limit the result to a subset of
entities. For example, to return the five rectangles with largest area, one could do the
following:

``` matlab
s = fetch(my_schema.Area, '*', 'ORDER BY shape_area DESC LIMIT 5')
```

The limit clause is passed directly to SQL and follows the same
[rules](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html)
